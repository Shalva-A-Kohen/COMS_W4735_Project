Note: If the RGB value is 0 that means the picture is not in the database. This is because some pictures were just not included in the database. 

color_1 = red  
color_2 = green  
color_3 = blue

After color there are 15 ratios. I took these ratios from this website: https://www.goldennumber.net/facial-beauty-new-golden-ratio/  
They are in the following order  
1. Hairline : Eyebrow top : Eye top  
2. Eye pupil : Nose flair : Nose bottom  
3. Eye pupil : Nose bottom : Mouth  
4. Eye pupil : Nose bottom : Chin  
5. Eye pupil : Mouth : Chin  
6. Face side : Eyebrows : Face side  
7. Face side : Eye inside : Face side  
8. Face side : Nose width : Face side  
9. Face side : Eye outside : Nose center on the left side
10. Face side : Eye outside : Nose center on the right side  
11. Eye outside : Eye inside : Nose center on the left side  
12. Eye outside : Eye inside : Nose center on the right side  
13. Mouth outside : Lip cupidâ€™s bow : Mouth outside  
14. Vertical Ratio  
15. Horizontal Ratio  

No need to use all of them.
